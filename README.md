## About

Pipable simplifies the process of querying a PostgreSQL database by allowing users to express their queries in natural language. It uses a language model to translate these natural language queries into SQL queries for the specific database and executes them on the server, returning the results in a structured format.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Express database queries in plain English.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Seamlessly connects to PostgreSQL databases.
- **Language Model Mapping**: Translates natural language queries into SQL queries.
- **Structured Results**: Returns query results in a structured format for easy processing.

## Installation

You can install Pipable using either the source distribution (tar.gz) or the wheel distribution (whl) available in the `dist/` directory.

### From Source Distribution (tar.gz)

```bash
pip3 install dist/pipable-<version>.tar.gz
```

Replace `<version>` with the appropriate version number of the package.

### From Wheel Distribution (whl)

```bash
pip3 install dist/pipable-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

Replace `<version>` with the appropriate version number of the package [current:1.0.0].

## Usage

```python
from pipable import Pipable
from pipable.core import PostgresConfig

# Initialize Pipable with PostgresConfig and LLM API base URL
postgres_config = PostgresConfig(
    host="your-postgresql-host",
    port=5432,
    database="your-database",
    user="your-username",
    password="your-password"
)
llm_api_base_url = "https://your-llm-api-url/"

# Connect to the PostgreSQL server and LLM API
pipable = Pipable(postgres_config=postgres_config, llm_api_base_url=llm_api_base_url)

# Example: Execute a natural language query
result = pipable.execute_query("Find all employees hired in the last month.")

# Process the results
for row in result:
    print(row)
```
