      "\n",
      "1. Gather your ingredients based on the recipe you choose. Basic ingredients for most cakes include flour, sugar, butter, eggs, baking powder/soda, salt, milk, and flavorings (e.g., vanilla extract).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat your oven to the required temperature stated in the recipe.\n",

      "3. Prepare your baking pans by greasing them lightly with butter or oil, and optionally flouring them to prevent sticking.\n",

      "4. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Then, add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n",
