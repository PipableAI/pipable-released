      "\n",
      "2. Preheat your oven to the required temperature stated in the recipe.\n",

      "3. Prepare your baking pans by greasing them lightly with butter or oil, and optionally flouring them to prevent sticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Then, add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder/soda, and salt). Gradually add this mixture to the creamed mixture, alternating with the milk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; avoid over-mixing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Add any desired flavorings, such as vanilla extract, and mix just until incorporated.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans and smooth the tops with a spatula.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for the time mentioned in the recipe. Avoid opening the oven door too often during baking to prevent heat loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Check the cake's doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean or with a few crumbs clinging to it. Be cautious not to overbake, as it can result in a dry cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for around 10 minutes. Then, transfer them onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting and decorating.\n",
